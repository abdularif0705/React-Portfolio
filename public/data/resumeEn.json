        "description": "üëãüèΩ I'm Abdul Arif, a graduate of the University of Windsor, with a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration. Currently, as a Software Engineer at Dayforce (Ceridian) I am on the Web Platform team creating React components for our app and am in the process of converting legacy Dojo code to React. \n\n Previously as a Research Software Engineer at the University, I engineered a pivotal MATLAB machine vision algorithm for Krown, utilizing RGB to HSI color conversion and pixel thresholding for accurate vehicle rust corrosion detection and assessment. I decomposed this critical MATLAB algorithm into C++ and developed an iOS app with Swift, enabling rust assessments directly from iPhones and enhancing field evaluation efficiency. Additionally, I created a Python MATLAB-based application with an intuitive GUI for advanced corrosion detection, streamlining the assessment process for vehicle rust analysis.\n\n As a Full Stack Developer at Haadi Solutions Inc., I lead the development of a React application for a US health clinic, designing and implementing a health intake form, integrating NodeMailer for multi-factor authentication, Azure for database management, and Twilio for SMS and voice communications.\n\nDuring my Software Engineer internship at TD Bank, I rebuilt a Java automation engine used by over 50 data engineers. I successfully integrated Spring and Swagger with the Delphix Masking API, cutting the engine's runtime by 50%. Then with JUnit and Mockito, I increased the test coverage from 70% to 90%. Furthermore, I onboarded new Software Engineers, walking them through the Java code used in the automation masking engine.\n\nI'm eager to tackle new challenges and continue making meaningful contributions as a software engineer. In the section below, you can explore some of the exciting projects I have worked on. Make sure to check out one of my favourite projects - Tradewise where we obtained over 7000 users in just 1 month.",
