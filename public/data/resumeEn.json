        "description": "üëãüèΩ I'm Abdul Arif, a graduate of the University of Windsor, with a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration. In my current role as a Software Engineer at Dayforce (Ceridian), I am part of the Web Platform team creating React components for the app and switching our code base from legacy Dojo code to React for optimal performance. And enhance our RichTextEditor performance for 5000+ global B2B customers. Currently focused on developing a custom AI solution for the RTE leveraging our in-house LLM, replacing the TinyMCE AI plugin by replicating its UI elements (dialog box, buttons, etc.) and functionalities using React, saving Dayforce approximately $52K annually. \n\n Previously as a Research Software Engineer at the University, I engineered a pivotal MATLAB machine vision algorithm for Krown, utilizing RGB to HSI color conversion and pixel thresholding for accurate vehicle rust corrosion detection and assessment. I decomposed this critical MATLAB algorithm into C++ and developed an iOS app with Swift, enabling rust assessments directly from iPhones and enhancing field evaluation efficiency. Additionally, I created a Python MATLAB-based application with an intuitive GUI for advanced corrosion detection, streamlining the assessment process for vehicle rust analysis.\n\n As a Full Stack Developer at Haadi Solutions Inc., I lead the development of a React application for a US health clinic, designing and implementing a health intake form, integrating NodeMailer for multi-factor authentication, Azure for database management, and Twilio for SMS and voice communications.\n\nDuring my Software Engineer internship at TD Bank, I rebuilt a Java automation engine used by over 50 data engineers. I successfully integrated Spring and Swagger with the Delphix Masking API, cutting the engine's runtime by 50%. Then with JUnit and Mockito, I increased the test coverage from 70% to 90%. Furthermore, I onboarded new Software Engineers, walking them through the Java code used in the automation masking engine.\n\nI'm eager to tackle new challenges and continue making meaningful contributions as a software engineer. In the section below, you can explore some of the exciting projects I have worked on. Make sure to check out one of my favourite projects - Tradewise where we obtained over 7000 users in just 1 month.",
